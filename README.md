# Vaadin Loom

A prototype project which tries to implement Vaadin Blocking dialogs using the Java Project Loom.
Uses [Vaadin Boot](https://github.com/mvysny/vaadin-boot). Requires Java 20+.

# Warning

This is not even alpha quality. If it works, it works just by a random coincidence. I'm just hacking
deep into virtual threads, without really knowing what I'm really doing. Prototype quality.

# Documentation

Please see the [Vaadin Boot](https://github.com/mvysny/vaadin-boot#preparing-environment) documentation
on how you run, develop and package this Vaadin-Boot-based app.
